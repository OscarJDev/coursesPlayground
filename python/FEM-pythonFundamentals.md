## 01. Introduction

**Creating a virtual environment**

> A virtual environment in Python is a self-contained  directory containing a Python installation for a particular version of Python.
> It's a very useful way to make sure that we're using the right Python version when we are working on a particular project.

```powershell
mkdir pyworshop
cd pyworkshop
py -3 -m venv env
env\scripts\activate
```
*env\scripts\activate is how we activate our virtual environment in Windows. We'll want to do that each time we enter this Python project directly from a new shell*
